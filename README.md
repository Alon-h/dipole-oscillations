## Magnetic dipole coupled oscillations - M.D.C.O

In this project we analyze coupled Oscillating magnets modeled as dipoles on rods, as in the following sketch:

In this system there are 3 magnets with equal strengths $\left|\vec{m}_ {1}\right|=\left|\vec{m}_ {3}\right|=\left|\vec{m}_{3}\right|$, one stationary in the middle and two that can freely rotate around a rod of length $R$.
We will use a few assumptions.
1. The magnets can be modeled as a magnetic dipole.
2. Air resistance is completely neglected, and so are the rods' masses.
