## Magnetic dipole coupled oscillators - M.D.C.O

In this project we analyze coupled Oscillating magnets modeled as dipoles on rods, as in the following sketch:

In this system there are 3 magnets of equal strengths $\left|\vec{m}_ {1}\right|=\left|\vec{m}_ {3}\right|=\left|\vec{m}_{3}\right|$, one stationary in the middle and two that can freely rotate around a rod of length $R$.
We will use a few assumptions.
1. The magnets can be modeled as a magnetic dipole moment.
2. Air resistance is completely neglected, and so are the rods' masses.

Before we jumped into this intimidating problem, we solved a similar one as can be be seen in this sketch:

as you can see this system avoids the effect of gravity by making the magnets rotate around their center and thus we can trivially conclude that $0^\circ$ is the angle of stability. This system also makes the magnetic field calculations a lot simpler
we will use the equations for a magnetic field produced by a magnetic moment and the potential energy of a dipole in a field:

$$ \vec{B} = \frac{\mu_ 0}{4\pi}\frac{3\hat{r} \left( \hat{r}\cdot \vec{m} \right)-\vec{m}}{\left| r \right|^3}, U = -\vec{m}\cdot \vec{B}$$

from those two equations we can get the pair-wise magnetic potential of each magent pair

$$ U_{12} = , U_{21} = , U_{13} = , U_{31} = , U_{23}  = , U_{32} = $$

With those and with the rotational kinetic energy $K = \frac{1}{2}I\left(\dot{\theta_1}^2+\dot{\theta_2}^2\right)$
We get the Lagrangian

$$ L = $$
